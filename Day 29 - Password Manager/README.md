This project utilizes the tkinter library to create a Password Manager. Once the fields are filled out and submitted, the information is exported to a JSON file for future reference. An option to automatically generate a password is provided. This option creates a secure password of letters, numbers, and symbols and copies the final password to the clipboard to allow the user to paste into a website. There is also a search button to find login information for the user specified website if it has already been saved.
