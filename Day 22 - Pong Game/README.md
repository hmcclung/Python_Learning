This project is a recreation of the pong game. There are paddles on the left and right side of the screen that are controlled by the keyboard arrow keys and the "W" and "S" buttons. A ball moves from one side of the screen to the other bouncing against the wall and the paddles. The ball will increase speed the longer the game goes on and if the ball moves past the paddle a point is awarded to the other side.
