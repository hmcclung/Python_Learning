This project utilizes SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to automatically send a happy birthday email. The program reads from a csv document that lists people and their birthdays, check to see if a birthday is occuring on that day, and if it is then the program will send one of three happy birthday emails with the recipients name in the greeting.

When trying to use this program, an email address and password will need to be entered into the code. The password won't just be the email password but rather a security key that can be set up through Google account>Security>Two Factor Authentication>App Passwords>Type app password>Then copy and paste that 16 character password into code.

To get the code to run continuously, Pythonanywhere.com can be utilized to schedule a daily time to run the code. First the files need to be uploaded, then type python3 into main.py. When running there, Google might block the sign in and so the display/unlock captcha feature would need to be enabled which can be done by following the support error link that is generated when the code is run.
