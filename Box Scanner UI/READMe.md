This is a GUI I developed for a box scanning application as a short term solution for tracking box data. The program works in tandem with another software program that was used to scan RFID chips on plastic parts. The program reads information from a text file and then creates a new text file with only the unique IDD information from the tags. It also allows the user to enter the box ID so the filenames are associated with different lots. To run this, I created a bash file that opened both programs for the user once the executable was clicked.

Following this program, I developed a C# program that utilized the SDK from an RFID scanning company. Since that is proprietary it is not shared. However, its functionality was essentially to activate the RFID reader, display the RFID count on the screen, stop the RFID reader, and save the IDD information into a new file. There were visual aids to help the operator know if something was disconnected or the count was off from what it should be based on the bag sizes and a seperate testing mode. To create the UI, I utilized WPF.
