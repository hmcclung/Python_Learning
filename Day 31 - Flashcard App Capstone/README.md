This project utilizes the tkinter and pandas modules to create a flashcard app for studying french. The program reads from a csv document of common french words and their english translations and can output a new csv of words to learn. The program will start by displaying a random french word for a couple seconds before flipping the card over to the english translation. If the user is correct they can hit the green checkmark and the word will be eliminated from the list, otherwise they can hit the red x button which will keep the word in the list for continued study.
